# Research
* * *

## [Research 1](./research1.pdf).

>Was assigned to looking into different cryptocurrencies and wrote this research
> specifically on Limitless VIP and Maker DAO. This was a good introduction
> into the business and technically aspects of blockchain. Limitless VIP was
> essentially a scam, which was a good example of what many think of this
> sector. Maker DAO on the other hand was an interesting ecosystem of different
> types of blockchains for functionality like stable coins and coins that holder
> voting rights towards future decisions.

## [Research 2](./research2.pdf).

>Assigned to look into the "economics" of cryptocurrency and found my initial
> information through a youtube video by economics explained. In this video
> cryptocurrency is broken down into subgrades and completely graded as a
> universal currency. What I took from this video and further research I did
> was the negative connotation crypto had when looking from an economics point
> of view.
> I also did research into the individual Vitalik Buterin who would become my
> next weeks research topic.

## [Research 3](./research3.pdf).

>Vitalik Buterin created ether and Ethereum and is the singular public figure
> that has created and maintained a successful cryptocurrency. The creator of
> bitcoin uses a pseudonym and no one knows their true identity. He mentions
> many of the philosophical aspects of creating a dementalized currency, and
> mentions how he believes it is less likely that fiat currencies will fail
> since he start questioning Austrian economics. An insider perspective is
> hard to come by in this field so listening to his outlook for the future
> is insightful.
