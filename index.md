# MileStones
* * *

## [Milestone1](./Milestone1.pdf).

>Explaining three different options I put on the top of my application
>list. I brain stormed the stakeholders and perceived and unperceived
>challenges the project may have.

## [Milestone2](./Milestone2.pdf).

> A comprehensive outline of challenges and goals for our project at the time
> of writing it. Though some of the scope and technical aspects of the project
> have changed since then, the user stories and expected outcome still hold true.



# Research
* * *

## [Research 1](./research1.pdf).

>Was assigned to looking into different cryptocurrencies and wrote this research
> specifically on Limitless VIP and Maker DAO. This was a good introduction
> into the business and technically aspects of blockchain. Limitless VIP was
> essentially a scam, which was a good example of what many think of this
> sector. Maker DAO on the other hand was an interesting ecosystem of different
> types of blockchains for functionality like stable coins and coins that hold
> voting rights towards future decisions.

## [Research 2](./research2.pdf).

>Assigned to look into the "economics" of cryptocurrency and found my initial
> information through a youtube video by economics explained. In this video
> cryptocurrency is broken down into subgrades and completely graded as a
> universal currency. What I took from this video and further research I did
> was the negative connotation crypto had when looking from an economics point
> of view.
> I also did research into the individual Vitalik Buterin who would become my
> next weeks research topic.

## [Research 3](./research3.pdf).

>Vitalik Buterin created ether and Ethereum and is the singular public figure
> that has created and maintained a successful cryptocurrency. The creator of
> bitcoin uses a pseudonym and no one knows their true identity. He mentions
> many of the philosophical aspects of creating a dementalized currency, and
> mentions how he believes it is less likely that fiat currencies will fail
> since he start questioning Austrian economics. An insider perspective is
> hard to come by in this field so listening to his outlook for the future
> is insightful.

## [Research 4](./research4.pdf).

> Went over cliques of current project while blockchain was still involved in
> it. Raised some of these with the group leader and was instructed for our next
> research to be on alternative ideas for blockchain projects. This document
> contains both my critiques and my alternative idea.

# Group Presentation
* * *

## [Presentation](./DesignReview.pdf)

> We did not receive any non-verbal feed back from our reviewees and limited
> feed back even verbally. I think this is due to our project being outside
> the scope of many peoples understanding of blockchain. Since our project still
> used blockchain technology at this point there was not a lot of helpful
> insight from other teams.

# Term Retrospective
* * *

## [Retrospective](./TermRetrospective.pdf)

> With out project goal changing we were able deliver our website as well as
> create future goals that give as a good look at how we will move forward.
> The website will be essential to displaying future work he have done and
> allow us to communicate our goals and progress.

# Team Role
* * *

> I primarily did research having to do with business and economic aspects of
> our project since I saw those decisions needed to be made before moving forward
> into technical aspects. I had critiques of how blockchain interacted with our
> project to make a full fledge business model from the research I had done and
> was vocal in changing our scope or project. I created several ideas of
> alternative projects before as a team we decided to move forward with the
> original project without blockchain being involved.

# Future Outlook
* * *

> Moving forward we will be leaving behind the blockchain research we have done
> since the scope of the project would be too large. We have now focused in
> on the original functionality of a micro payment system and have looked into
> possible architectures to use. We have agreed on a node application with other
> infrastructure to enhance its usability. Over the break we are to look into
> possible frameworks and learn more about good implementation of our kind of
> project. We will use user stories we have created to guide our future research.
